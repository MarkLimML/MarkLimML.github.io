                                <p>The COMET Inc. is a team dedicated in making apps compatible with users who enjoy music. 
                                    It started with a project of a mobile game with a “first one to guess the song” type of mechanic. 
                                    Because this project is relatively new to the industry, multiple features are to be added.
                                    For now, the SONGWORM is still in its beta version. </p>

                                <p>To document the process of the app, this blog writes its research documentation in the "Recent Updates"
                                    tab. Here, the visitor will see the questions we've come up with, and the methods we used to form the 
                                    conclusion. This tab will be updated regularly, to keep our users up to date with what's going on with
                                    the app and the future plans we will be considering. For any questions or considerations, please feel

                                <h1>Jerald's POV</h1>
                                <p>In our COMET workshop, I've learned much about the concept of HTML and the importance of front-end coding
                                    in presenting the data collected. More specifically, the workshop has taught me much advancements to HTML
                                    that I have not yet come across, such as the bootstrap and the css implementation.
                                </p>
                                <p>Moreover, I have also learned much about using the VS Studio Code for HTML, as well as the different features 
                                    it holds to make coding in HTML more convenient. Some of these include the beautify command that makes the 
                                    code much cleaner to look at, and the *3 command that makes it more convenient to add table cells. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Just like in the previous workshops, I've also come to learn more about cooperating, working with other people
                                    and coming into a compromise from different sets of ideas into one working idea. Furthermore, I have also learned 
                                    to schedule my time better, balancing both doing COMET projects and attending meetings, and keeping up with my 
                                    academics.  
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, the workshop was successful iin teaching their probies and giving them sufficient knowledge for them to 
                                    edit their code in their own unique way. With this, I am very much looking forward to future workshops and events,
                                    and will try my best to live up to the standards set. 
                                </p><br>

                                <h1>Mark's POV</h1>
                                <p>What I learned in our COMET workshop was how versatile css could allow html to be designed in. In more ways than one, I
                                gained a new and fresh perspective on coding with html, even if I was taught its basics back in highschool. The workshop helped me
                                realize that theres more than just the basic standard html code thats capable of making a website look appealing, but that there are many
                                ways to design and create such web pages, some easier than others.
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition, using visual studio code as the IDE for html, the IDE itself is useful in more ways than I had initially thought.
                                The program itself could have add-ons installed depending on the coding language used, or outside third-party applications that could
                                interact with the code itself.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, the things I learned in the workshop helped me learn that knowing the basics is good, but knowing more than just using the basics
                                  is better, and that there are many things in coding that are simple unexplored, techniques unknown to us, and a large and vast network of
                                  tools that could make coding way easier than ever before.
